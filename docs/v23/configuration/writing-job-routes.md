Writing Job Routes
==================

This document contains documentation for HTCondor-CE Job Router configurations with equivalent examples for the
[ClassAd transform](job-router-overview.md#classad-transforms) and
[deprecated](job-router-overview.md#deprecated-syntax) syntaxes.
Configuration from this page should be written to files in `/etc/condor-ce/config.d/`, whose contents are parsed in
lexicographic order with subsequent variables overriding earlier ones.

Each example is displayed in code blocks with tabs to switch between the two syntaxes:

=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```
    This is an example for the ClassAd transform syntax
    ```

=== "Deprecated syntax"

    ```
    This is an example for the deprecated syntax
    ```

Syntax Differences
------------------

!!! warning "Planned Removal of Deprecated Syntax"
    -   `JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS`, `JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES`, `JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES_CMD`, and `JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES_FILE` are
    deprecated and will be removed for *V24* of the HTCondor Software Suite. New configuration syntax for the job router
    is defined using `JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES` and `JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_[name]`.
    -   For new syntax example vist:
    [HTCondor Documentation - Job Router](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/lts/grid-computing/job-router.html#an-example-configuration)
    -   **Note:** The removal will occur during the lifetime of the HTCondor *V23* feature series.


In HTCondor-CE 23, the [deprecated syntax](job-router-overview.md#deprecated-syntax) continues to be the default and
administrator's can move to the [ClassAd transform syntax](job-router-overview.md#classad-transforms) by setting the
following in a file in `/etc/condor-ce/config.d/`:

```
JOB_ROUTER_USE_DEPRECATED_ROUTER_ENTRIES = False
```

The [ClassAd transform](job-router-overview.md#classad-transforms) syntax provides many benefits including:

-   Statements being evaluated in [the order they are written](#editing-attributes)
-   Use of variables that are not included in the resultant job ad
-   Use simple case-like logic

Additionally, it is now easier to include job transformations that should be evaluated before or after your routes by
including transforms in the lists of `JOB_ROUTER_PRE_ROUTE_TRANSFORM_NAMES` and `JOB_ROUTER_POST_ROUTE_TRANSFORM_NAMES`,
respectively.

For examples of the ClassAd transform syntax, you can inspect default job router transforms packaged with HTCondor-CE
with the following command:

``` bash
user@host $ condor_ce_config_val -dump JOB_ROUTER_TRANSFORM_
```

### Differences in `MY.` and `TARGET.` ###

In addition to the above, the behavior of the `MY.` and `TARGET.` ClassAd attribute prefixes has changed between the two
different syntaxes:

-   **In ClassAd transform syntax,** `MY.` always refers to the incoming job's attributes and can be referenced within
    `$()`, e.g. `$(MY.Owner)` refers to the mapped user of the incoming job.
    `TARGET` is only used in [SET](#setting-attributes) expressions to refer to attributes in the slot ad (HTCondor
    pools only).
-   **In the deprecated syntax,** `MY.` refers to attributes in the job route and `TARGET.` refers to attributes in the
    incoming job ad for [copy\_](#copying-attributes), [delete\_](#removing-attributes), and
    [eval\_set\_](#setting-attributes-with-classad-expressions) functions.
    However, in expressions defined by [set\_*](#setting-attributes), `MY.` refers to the attributes in the incoming job
    ad and `TARGET.` refers to the attribute in the slot ad (HTCondor pools only).

Required Fields
---------------

The minimum requirements for a route are that you specify the type of batch system that jobs should be routed to and a
name for each route.
Default routes can be found in `/usr/share/condor-ce/config.d/02-ce-<batch system>-defaults.conf`, provided by the
`htcondor-ce-<batch system>` packages.

### Route name

To identify routes, you will need to assign a name to the route, either in the name of the configuration macro
(i.e., `JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_<name>`) for the ClassAd transform syntax or with the `name` attribute for the deprecated syntax:

=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```hl_lines="1"
    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_Condor_Pool @=jrt
      UNIVERSE VANILLA
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

=== "Deprecated syntax"

    ```hl_lines="4"
    JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre
    [
      TargetUniverse = 5;
      name = "Condor_Pool";
    ]

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

!!! warning "Naming restrictions"
    -   Route names should only contain alphanumeric and `_` characters.
    -   Routes specified by `JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_*` will override routes with the same name in `JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES`

The name of the route will be useful in debugging since it shows up in the output of
[condor\_ce\_job\_router\_info](../troubleshooting/debugging-tools.md#condor_ce_job_router_info);
the [JobRouterLog](../troubleshooting/logs.md#jobrouterlog);
in the ClassAd of the routed job, which can be viewed with `condor_q` and `condor_history` for HTCondor batch systems;
and in the ClassAd of the routed job, which can be vieweed with 
[condor\_ce\_q](../troubleshooting/debugging-tools.md#condor_ce_q) or
[condor\_ce\_history](../troubleshooting/debugging-tools.md#condor_ce_history) for non-HTCondor batch systems.

### Batch system

Each route needs to indicate the type of batch system that jobs should be routed to.
For HTCondor batch systems, the `UNIVERSE` command or `TargetUniverse` attribute needs to be set to `"VANILLA"` or `5`,
respectively.
For all other batch systems, the `GridResource` attribute needs to be set to `"batch <batch system>"`
(where `<batch system>` can be one of `pbs`, `slurm`, `lsf`, or `sge`).


=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```hl_lines="2 6 7"
    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_Condor_Pool @=jrt
      UNIVERSE VANILLA
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_My_Slurm @=jrt
      GridResource = "batch slurm"
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool My_Slurm
    ```

=== "Deprecated syntax"

    ```hl_lines="3 7 8"
    JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre
    [
      TargetUniverse = 5;
      name = "Condor_Pool";
    ]
    [
      GridResource = "batch slurm";
      name = "My_Slurm";
    ]
    @jre

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool My_Slurm
    ```

Writing Multiple Routes
-----------------------

If your batch system needs incoming jobs to be sorted (e.g. if different VO's need to go to separate queues), you will
need to write multiple job routes where each route is a separate `JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_*` macro in the ClassAd transform
syntax and enclosed by square brackets in the deprecated syntax.
Additionally, the route names must be added to `JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES` in the order that you want their requirements
statements compared to incoming jobs.

The following routes takes incoming jobs that have a `queue` attribute set to `"prod"` and sets `IsProduction = True`.
All other jobs will be routed with `IsProduction = False`.

=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```hl_lines="1 7 12"
    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_Production_Jobs @=jrt
      REQUIREMENTS queue == "prod"
      UNIVERSE VANILLA
      SET IsProduction = True
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_Condor_Pool @=jrt
      UNIVERSE VANILLA
      SET IsProduction = False
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Production_Jobs Condor_Pool
    ```

=== "Deprecated syntax"

    ```hl_lines="2 7 8 12 15"
    JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre
    [
      Requirements = (TARGET.queue == "prod");
      TargetUniverse = 5;
      set_IsProduction = True;
      name = "Production_Jobs";
    ]
    [
      TargetUniverse = 5;
      set_IsProduction = False;
      name = "Condor_Pool";
    ]
    @jre

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Production_Jobs Condor_Pool
    ```

Writing Comments
----------------

To write comments you can use `#` to comment a line:

=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```hl_lines="2"
    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_Condor_Pool @=jrt
      # This is a comment
      UNIVERSE VANILLA
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

=== "Deprecated syntax"

    ```hl_lines="5"
    JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre
    [
      TargetUniverse = 5;
      name = "Condor_Pool";
      # This is a comment
    ]
    @jre

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

Setting Attributes for All Routes
---------------------------------

### ClassAd transform

With the ClassAd transform syntax, any function from the [Editing Attributes section](#editing-attributes) can be
applied before or after your routes are considered by appending the names of transforms specified by
`JOB_ROUTER_TRANSFORM_<name>` to the lists of `JOB_ROUTER_PRE_ROUTE_TRANSFORM_NAMES` and
`JOB_ROUTER_POST_ROUTE_TRANSFORM_NAMES`,
respectively.
The following configuration sets the `Periodic_Hold` attribute for all routed jobs before any route transforms are
applied:

```
JOB_ROUTER_TRANSFORM_Periodic_Hold
  SET Periodic_Hold = (NumJobStarts >= 1 && JobStatus == 1) || NumJobStarts > 1
@jrt

JOB_ROUTER_PRE_ROUTE_TRANSFORM_NAMES = $(JOB_ROUTER_PRE_ROUTE_TRANSFORM_NAMES) Periodic_Hold
```

To apply the same transform after your pre-route and route transforms, append the name of the transform to
`JOB_ROUTER_POST_ROUTE_TRANSFORM_NAMES` instead:

```
JOB_ROUTER_POST_ROUTE_TRANSFORM_NAMES = $(JOB_ROUTER_POST_ROUTE_TRANSFORM_NAMES) Periodic_Hold
```

### Deprecated syntax

To set an attribute that will be applied to all routes, you will need to ensure that `MERGE_JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULT_ADS` is
set to `True` (check the value with [condor\_ce\_config\_val](../troubleshooting/debugging-tools.md#condor_ce_config_val))
and use the [set_](#setting-attributes) function in the `JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS`.
The following configuration sets the `Periodic_Hold` attribute for all routes:

```hl_lines="7"
# Use the defaults generated by the condor_ce_router_defaults script.  To add
# additional defaults, add additional lines of the form:
#
#   JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS = $(JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS) [set_foo = 1;]
#
MERGE_JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULT_ADS=True
JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS = $(JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS) [set_Periodic_Hold = (NumJobStarts >= 1 && JobStatus == 1) || NumJobStarts > 1;]
```

Filtering Jobs Based On…
------------------------

To filter jobs, use the route's `REQUIREMENTS` or `Requirements` attribute for ClassAd transforms and deprecated
syntaxes, respectively.
Incoming jobs will be evaluated against the ClassAd expression set in the route's requirements and if the expression
evaluates to `TRUE`, the route will match.
More information on the syntax of ClassAd's can be found in the
[HTCondor manual](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/lts/misc-concepts/classad-mechanism.html).
For an example on how incoming jobs interact with filtering in job routes, consult
[this document](../remote-job-submission.md).

In the deprecated syntax, you may need to specify `TARGET.` to refer to differentiate between job and route attributes. 
See [this section](#differences-in-my-and-target) for more details.

!!! note
    If you have an HTCondor batch system, note the difference with
    [set\_requirements](htcondor-routes.md#setting-routed-job-requirements):

### Pilot job queue ###

To filter jobs based on their pilot job queue attribute, your routes will need a requirements expression using the
incoming job's `queue` attribute.
The following entry routes jobs to HTCondor if the incoming job (specified by `TARGET`) is an `analy` (Analysis) glidein:

=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```hl_lines="2"
    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_Condor_Pool @=jrt
      REQUIREMENTS queue == "prod"
      UNIVERSE VANILLA
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

=== "Deprecated syntax"

    ```hl_lines="3"
    JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre
    [
      Requirements = (TARGET.queue == "prod");
      TargetUniverse = 5;
      name = "Condor_Pool";
    ]
    @jre

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = My_HTCONDOR
    ```

### Mapped user ###

To filter jobs based on what local account the incoming job was mapped to, your routes will need a requirements
expression using the incoming job's `Owner` attribute.
The following entry routes jobs to the HTCondor batch system if the mapped user is `usatlas2`:

=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```hl_lines="2"
    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_Condor_Pool @=jrt
      REQUIREMENTS Owner == "usatlas2"
      UNIVERSE VANILLA
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

=== "Deprecated syntax"

    ```hl_lines="3"
    JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre
    [
      Requirements = (TARGET.Owner == "usatlas2");
      TargetUniverse = 5;
      name = "Condor_Pool";
    ]
    @jre

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = My_HTCONDOR
    ```

Alternatively, you can match based on regular expression.
The following entry routes jobs to the HTCondor batch system if the mapped user begins with `usatlas`:

=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```hl_lines="2"
    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_Condor_Pool @=jrt
      REQUIREMENTS regexp("^usatlas", Owner)
      UNIVERSE VANILLA
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

=== "Deprecated syntax"

    ```hl_lines="3"
    JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre
    [
      Requirements = regexp("^usatlas", TARGET.Owner);
      TargetUniverse = 5;
      name = "Condor_Pool";
    ]
    @jre

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = My_HTCONDOR
    ```

### VOMS attribute ###

To filter jobs based on the subject of the job's proxy, your routes will need a requirements expression using the
incoming job's `x509UserProxyFirstFQAN` attribute.
The following entry routes jobs to the HTCondor batch system if the proxy subject contains `/cms/Role=Pilot`:


=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```hl_lines="2"
    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_Condor_Pool @=jrt
      REQUIREMENTS regexp("\/cms\/Role\=pilot", x509UserProxyFirstFQAN)
      UNIVERSE VANILLA
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

=== "Deprecated syntax"

    ```hl_lines="3"
    JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre
    [
      Requirements = regexp("\/cms\/Role\=pilot", TARGET.x509UserProxyFirstFQAN);
      TargetUniverse = 5;
      name = "Condor_Pool";
    ]
    @jre

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = My_HTCONDOR
    ```

Setting a Default…
------------------

This section outlines how to set default job limits, memory, cores, and maximum walltime.
For an example on how users can override these defaults, consult
[this document](../remote-job-submission.md#submit-the-job).

### Maximum number of jobs ###

To set a default limit to the maximum number of jobs per route, you can edit the configuration variable
`CONDORCE_MAX_JOBS` in `/etc/condor-ce/config.d/01-ce-router.conf`:

```
CONDORCE_MAX_JOBS = 10000
```

!!! note
    The above configuration is to be placed directly into the HTCondor-CE configuration instead of a job route or
    transform.

### Maximum memory ###

To set a default maximum memory (in MB) for routed jobs, set the variable or attribute `default_maxMemory` for the
ClassAd transform and deprecated syntax, respectively:

=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```hl_lines="4"
    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_Condor_Pool @=jrt
      UNIVERSE VANILLA
      # Set the requested memory to 1 GB
      default_maxMemory = 1000
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

=== "Deprecated Syntax"

    ```hl_lines="6"
    JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre
    [
      TargetUniverse = 5;
      name = "Condor_Pool";
      # Set the requested memory to 1 GB
      set_default_maxMemory = 1000;
    ]
    @jre

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

### Number of cores to request ###

To set a default number of cores for routed jobs, set the variable or attribute `default_xcount` for the ClassAd
transform and deprecated syntax, respectively:


=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```hl_lines="4"
    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_Condor_Pool @=jrt
      UNIVERSE VANILLA
      # Set the requested memory to 1 GB
      default_xcount = 8
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

=== "Deprecated Syntax"

    ```hl_lines="6"
    JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre
    [
      TargetUniverse = 5;
      name = "Condor_Pool";
      # Set the requested cores to 8
      set_default_xcount = 8;
    ]
    @jre

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

### Number of gpus to request ###

To set a default number of GPUs for routed jobs, set the job ClassAd attribute `RequestGPUs` in the route
transform:

=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```hl_lines="4"
    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_Condor_Pool @=jrt
      UNIVERSE VANILLA
      # If the job does not already have a RequestGPUs value set it to 1
      DEFAULT RequestGPUs = 1
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

The `DEFAULT` keyword works for any job attribute other than those mentioned above that require the use of
alternative names for defaulting in the CE.  The deprecated syntax has no keyword for defaulting.

### Maximum walltime ###

To set a default number of cores for routed jobs, set the variable or attribute `default_maxWallTime` for the ClassAd
transform and deprecated syntax, respectively:

=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```hl_lines="4"
    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_Condor_Pool @=jrt
      UNIVERSE VANILLA
      # Set the max walltime to 1 hr
      default_maxWallTime = 60
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

=== "Deprecated Syntax"

    ```hl_lines="6"
    JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre
    [
      TargetUniverse = 5;
      name = "Condor_Pool";
      # Set the max walltime to 1 hr
      set_default_maxWallTime = 60;
    ]
    @jre

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

Setting Job Environments
------------------------

HTCondor-CE offers two different methods for setting environment variables of routed jobs:

- `CONDORCE_PILOT_JOB_ENV` configuration, which should be used for setting environment variables for all routed jobs to
  static strings.
- `default_pilot_job_env` or `set_default_pilot_job_env` job route configuration, which should be used for setting
  environment variables:
    - Per job route
    - To values based on incoming job attributes
    - Using [ClassAd functions](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/lts/misc-concepts/classad-mechanism.html#predefined-functions)

Both of these methods use the new HTCondor format of the
[environment command](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/lts/man-pages/condor_submit.html#index-14), which is
described by environment variable/value pairs separated by whitespace and enclosed in double-quotes.
For example, the following HTCondor-CE configuration would result in the following environment for all routed jobs:


=== "HTCondor-CE Configuration"

    ```
    CONDORCE_PILOT_JOB_ENV = "WN_SCRATCH_DIR=/nobackup/ http_proxy=proxy.wisc.edu"
    ```

=== "Resulting Environment"

    ```bash
    WN_SCRATCH_DIR=/nobackup/
    http_proxy=proxy.wisc.edu
    ```

Contents of `CONDORCE_PILOT_JOB_ENV` can reference other HTCondor-CE configuration using HTCondor's configuration
[$() macro expansion](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/lts/admin-manual/introduction-to-configuration.html#configuration-file-macros).
For example, the following HTCondor-CE configuration would result in the following environment for all routed jobs:

=== "HTCondor-CE Configuration"

    ```
    LOCAL_PROXY = proxy.wisc.edu
    CONDORCE_PILOT_JOB_ENV = "WN_SCRATCH_DIR=/nobackup/ http_proxy=$(LOCAL_PROXY)"
    ```

=== "Resulting Environment"

    ```bash
    WN_SCRATCH_DIR=/nobackup/
    http_proxy=proxy.wisc.edu
    ```

To set environment variables per job route, based on incoming job attributes, or using ClassAd functions, add
`default_pilot_job_env` or `set_default_pilot_job_env` to your job route configuration for ClassAd transforms and
deprecated syntax, respectively.
For example, the following HTCondor-CE configuration would result in this environment for a job with these attributes:

=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```hl_lines="3 4 5" 
    JOB_ROUTER_Condor_Pool @=jrt
      UNIVERSE VANILLA
      default_pilot_job_env = strcat("WN_SCRATCH_DIR=/nobackup",
                                     " PILOT_COLLECTOR=", JOB_COLLECTOR,
                                     " ACCOUNTING_GROUP=", toLower(JOB_VO))
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

=== "Deprecated Syntax"

    ```hl_lines="5 6 7" 
    JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre
    [
      TargetUniverse = 5;
      name = "Condor_Pool";
      set_default_pilot_job_env = strcat("WN_SCRATCH_DIR=/nobackup",
                                         " PILOT_COLLECTOR=", JOB_COLLECTOR,
                                         " ACCOUNTING_GROUP=", toLower(JOB_VO));
    ]
    @jre

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

=== "Incoming Job Attributes"

    ```
    JOB_COLLECTOR = "collector.wisc.edu"
    JOB_VO = "GLOW"
    ```

=== "Resulting Environment"

    ```bash 
    WN_SCRATCH_DIR=/nobackup/
    PILOT_COLLECTOR=collector.wisc.edu
    ACCOUNTING_GROUP=glow
    ```

!!!tip "Debugging job route environment expressions"
    While constructing `default_pilot_job_env` or `set_default_pilot_job_env` expressions, try wrapping your expression
    in [debug()](#debugging-routes) to help with any issues that may arise.
    Make sure to remove `debug()` after you're done!

Editing Attributes…
-------------------

The following functions are operations that can be used to take incoming job attributes and modify them for the routed
job for the ClassAd transform and deprecated syntax, respectively:

1.  `COPY`, `copy_*`
2.  `DELETE`, `delete_*`
3.  `SET`, `set_*`
4.  `EVALSET`, `eval_set_*`

The above operations are evaluated in order differently depending on your chosen syntax:

-   **If you are using ClassAd transforms**, each function is evaluated in order of appearance.
    For example, the following will set `FOO` in the routed job to the incoming job's `Owner` attribute and then
    subsequently remove `FOO` from the routed job:

        JOB_ROUTER_Condor_Pool @=jrt
          EVALSET FOO = "$(MY.Owner)"
          DELETE FOO
        @jrt

-   **If you are using the deprecated syntax**, each class of operations is evaluated in the order specified above,
    i.e. all `copy_*`, before `delete_*`, etc.
    For example, if the attribute `FOO` is set using `eval_set_FOO` in the `JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS`, you'll be unable to use
    `delete_foo` to remove it from your jobs since the attribute is set using `eval_set_foo` after the deletion occurs
    according to the order of operations.
    To get around this, we can take advantage of the fact that operations defined in `JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS` get
    overridden by the same operation in `JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES`.
    So to 'delete' `FOO`, you could add `eval_set_foo = ""` to the route in the `JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES`, resulting in `foo`
    being set to the empty string in the routed job.

More documentation can be found in the
[HTCondor manual](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/lts/grid-computing/job-router.html#routing-table-entry-commands-and-macro-values)

### Copying attributes

To copy the value of an attribute of the incoming job to an attribute of the routed job, use `COPY` or `copy_` for
ClassAd transform and deprecated syntaxes, respectively..
The following route copies the `Environment` attribute of the incoming job and sets the attribute `Original_Environment`
on the routed job to the same value:


=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```hl_lines="3"
    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_Condor_Pool @=jrt
      UNIVERSE VANILLA
      COPY Environment Original_Environment
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

=== "Deprecated Syntax"

    ```hl_lines="5"
    JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre
    [
      TargetUniverse = 5;
      name = "Condor_Pool";
      copy_Environment = "Original_Environment";
    ]
    @jre

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

### Removing attributes

To remove an attribute of the incoming job from the routed job, use `DELETE` or `delete_` for ClassAd transform and
deprecated syntaxes, respectively.
The following route removes the `Environment` attribute from the routed job:


=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```hl_lines="3"
    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_Condor_Pool @=jrt
      UNIVERSE VANILLA
      DELETE Environment
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

=== "Deprecated Syntax"

    ```hl_lines="5"
    JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre
    [
      TargetUniverse = 5;
      name = "Condor_Pool";
      delete_Environment = True;
    ]
    @jre

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

### Setting attributes

To set an attribute on the routed job, use `SET` or `set_` for ClassAd transform and deprecated syntaxes, respectively.
The following route sets the Job's `Rank` attribute to 5:

=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```hl_lines="3"
    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_Condor_Pool @=jrt
      UNIVERSE VANILLA
      SET Rank = 5
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

=== "Deprecated Syntax"

    ```hl_lines="5"
    JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre
    [
      TargetUniverse = 5;
      name = "Condor_Pool";
      set_Rank = 5;
    ]
    @jre

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

### Setting attributes with ClassAd expressions

To set an attribute to a ClassAd expression to be evaluated, use `EVALSET` or `eval_set` for ClassAd transform and
deprecated syntaxes, respectively.
The following route sets the `Experiment` attribute to `atlas.osguser` if the Owner of the incoming job is `osguser`:

=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```hl_lines="3"
    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_Condor_Pool @=jrt
      UNIVERSE VANILLA
      EVALSET Experiment = strcat("atlas.", Owner)
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

=== "Deprecated Syntax"

    ```hl_lines="5"
    JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre
    [
      TargetUniverse = 5;
      name = "Condor_Pool";
      eval_set_Experiment = strcat("atlas.", Owner);
    ]
    @jre

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

Limiting the Number of Jobs
---------------------------

This section outlines how to limit the number of total or idle jobs in a specific route
(i.e., if this limit is reached, jobs will no longer be placed in this route).

!!! note
    If you are using an HTCondor batch system, limiting the number of jobs is not the preferred solution:
    HTCondor manages fair share on its own via
    [user priorities and group accounting](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/lts/admin-manual/cm-configuration.html#user-priorities-and-negotiation).

### Total jobs

To set a limit on the number of jobs for a specific route,
set the [MaxJobs](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/lts/grid-computing/job-router.html#index-6) attribute:

=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```hl_lines="3"
    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_Condor_Poole @=jrt
      UNIVERSE VANILLA
      MaxJobs = 100
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

=== "Deprecated Syntax"

    ```hl_lines="5"
    JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre
    [
      TargetUniverse = 5;
      name = "Condor_Pool";
      MaxJobs = 100;
    ]
    @jre

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

### Idle jobs

To set a limit on the number of idle jobs for a specific route,
set the [MaxIdleJobs](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/lts/grid-computing/job-router.html#index-7) attribute:

=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```hl_lines="3"
    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_Condor_Poole @=jrt
      UNIVERSE VANILLA
      MaxIdleJobs = 100
    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

=== "Deprecated Syntax"

    ```hl_lines="5"
    JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre
    [
      TargetUniverse = 5;
      name = "Condor_Pool";
      MaxIdleJobs = 100;
    ]
    @jre

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

Debugging Routes
----------------

To help debug expressions in your routes, you can use the `debug()` function.
First, set the debug mode for the JobRouter by editing a file in `/etc/condor-ce/config.d/` to read

```
JOB_ROUTER_DEBUG = D_ALWAYS:2 D_CAT
```

Then wrap the problematic attribute in `debug()`:

=== "ClassAd Transform"

    ```hl_lines="2"
    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_Condor_Pool @=jrt
      EVALSET Experiment = debug(strcat("atlas", Name))

    @jrt

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

=== "Deprecated Syntax"

    ```hl_lines="4"
    JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre
    [
      name = "Condor_Pool";
      eval_set_Experiment = debug(strcat("atlas", Name));
    ]
    @jre

    JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES = Condor_Pool
    ```

You will find the debugging output in `/var/log/condor-ce/JobRouterLog`.
