HTCondor-CE
===========

The [HTCondor-CE](#what-is-htcondor-ce) software is a *Compute Entrypoint* (CE) based on [HTCondor](http://htcondor.org) for sites
that are part of a larger computing grid
(e.g. [European Grid Infrastructure](https://www.egi.eu/), [The OSG Consortium](https://osg-htc.org/)).
As such, HTCondor-CE serves as a "door" for incoming resource allocation requests (RARs) — it handles authorization and
delegation of these requests to a grid site's local batch system.
Supported batch systems include
[Grid Engine](http://www.univa.com/products/),
[HTCondor](http://htcondor.org),
[LSF](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/hpc-workload-management),
[PBS Pro](https://www.altair.com/pbs-professional/)/[Torque](https://adaptivecomputing.com/cherry-services/torque-resource-manager/),
and [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/).

What is a Compute Entrypoint?
-----------------------------

A Compute Entrypoint (CE) is the door for remote organizations to submit requests to temporarily allocate local compute
resources.
These resource allocation requests are submitted as **pilot jobs** that create an environment for end-user jobs to match
and ultimately run within the pilot job.
CEs are made up of a thin layer of software that you install on a machine that already has the ability to submit and
manage jobs in your local batch system.

What is HTCondor-CE?
--------------------

HTCondor-CE is a special configuration of the HTCondor software designed as a Compute Entrypoint.
It is configured to use the HTCondor [Job Router daemon](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/lts/grid-computing/job-router.html)
to delegate resource allocation requests by transforming and submitting them to the site’s batch system.

Benefits of running the HTCondor-CE:

-   **Scalability:** HTCondor-CE is capable of supporting ~16k concurrent RARs
-   **Debugging tools:** HTCondor-CE offers
    [many tools to help troubleshoot](v24/troubleshooting/debugging-tools.md) issues with RARs
-   **Routing as configuration:** HTCondor-CE’s mechanism to transform and submit RARs is customized via configuration
    variables, which means that customizations will persist across upgrades and will not involve modification of
    software internals to route jobs
