!!! info "HTCondor-CE 3 Documentation"
    This documentation is for HTCondor-CE 3.
    If you need documentation for HTCondor-CE 4, please consult <https://htcondor-ce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/> instead.

The [HTCondor-CE](overview) software is a *job gateway* based on [HTCondor](http://htcondor.org) for Compute Elements
(CE) belonging to a computing grid
(e.g. [European Grid Infrastructure](https://www.egi.eu/), [Open Science Grid](https://opensciencegrid.org/)).
As such, HTCondor-CE serves as an entry point for incoming grid jobs — it handles authorization and delegation of jobs
to a grid site's local batch system.

Supported batch systems include:

- [Grid Engine](http://www.univa.com/products/)
- [HTCondor](http://htcondor.org)
- [LSF](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/hpc-workload-management)
- [PBS Pro](https://www.pbsworks.com/PBSProduct.aspx?n=Altair-PBS-Professional&c=Overview-and-Capabilities)/[Torque](http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/torque/)
- [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/)

See the [overview page](/overview) for more details on the features and architecture of HTCondor-CE.
